After, just select a legal met location from the list.\nYou'll need to find that using something like [serebii](https://serebii.net), or an in-game pokedex.\nNote: There may be other issues with the legality of your pokemon. Double check moves, level, etc., or use the legality checker in the same **misc** screen."

  {
    "title": "Why isn't my game showing up in Checkpoint?",
    "value": "There could be a few reasons.\n1. Make sure you have save data in the game. Checkpoint requires a save archive to locate a game.\n2. The game might save solely in ExtData. Press `X` and make sure it's not showing up there.\n3. Reload your titles using `B`. If you loaded Checkpoint before saving in game, you'll need to do this as Checkpoint doesn't check titles at each launch."
