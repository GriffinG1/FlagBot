After, just select a legal met location from the list.\nYou'll need to find that using something like [serebii](https://serebii.net), or an in-game pokedex.\nNote: There may be other issues with the legality of your pokemon. Double check moves, level, etc., or use the legality checker in the same **misc** screen."

Congrats, you've accessed the legality checker.\nPlease note: the legality checker requires a network connection. It cannot be handled on-3ds as it would destroy the 3ds."
